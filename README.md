# Gardens of the Galaxy

We're gonna put stuff here later.

## Appendices
### Appendix A: Adding OpenBCI Support
During this project, we were able to add support for OpenBCI devices to the [BCI Essentials Python](https://github.com/kirtonBCIlab/bci-essentials-python) utilities.

To replicate this, you'll need to follow these steps:
1. Install [OpenBCI LSL](https://github.com/openbci-archive/OpenBCI_LSL)
2. Install [Lab Recorder](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-LabRecorder) to determine stream properties
